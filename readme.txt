Monoblog is a widget plugin that allows recordings of you reading your blogs aloud for the seeing/reading impaired or for people on the go.

== Description ==

Combines the awesome functionality of <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com/">MediaElement.js HTML5 media player</a> and <a href='http://www.plupload.com/'>Plupload</a> to enable you or the authors of your site to upload mp3s of people reading the text of your blogs.

If you so choose, this plugin can also generate an audio podcast of your Monoblog content.
